## DryRun
---
Initially, the `front` and `rear` pointers are both set to `-1`, indicating that the circular queue is empty.

1.  The program displays the menu of options for the user to choose from:

```r
1. INSERT
2. DELETE
3. DISPLAY
4. EXIT
Enter your choice:
```

2.  The user enters `1` to insert an element into the circular queue.
    
3.  The program prompts the user to enter the element to be inserted into the circular queue:

```r
Enter the element to be inserted:
```

4.  The user enters the element, say `5`.
    
5.  The `insert` function is called with the argument `5`.
    
6.  The function checks if the circular queue is full or not. Since `front` is `-1` and `rear` is `-1`, the function sets `front` and `rear` to `0` and inserts `5` at the first position in the `queue` array.
    
7.  The program displays the menu of options for the user to choose from:

```r
1. INSERT
2. DELETE
3. DISPLAY
4. EXIT
Enter your choice:
```

8.  The user enters `1` to insert another element into the circular queue.
    
9.  The program prompts the user to enter the element to be inserted into the circular queue:

```r
Enter the element to be inserted:
```

10.  The user enters the element, say `3`.
    
11.  The `insert` function is called with the argument `3`.
    
12.  The function checks if the circular queue is full or not. Since `front` is `0` and `rear` is `1`, the function inserts `3` at the second position in the `queue` array.
    
13.  The program displays the menu of options for the user to choose from:

```r
1. INSERT
2. DELETE
3. DISPLAY
4. EXIT
Enter your choice:
```

14.  The user enters `3` to display the elements of the circular queue.
    
15.  The `display` function is called, which prints the elements of the circular queue:

```r
QUEUE:
5 3
```

16.  The program displays the menu of options for the user to choose from:

```r
1. INSERT
2. DELETE
3. DISPLAY
4. EXIT
Enter your choice:
```

17.  The user enters `2` to delete an element from the circular queue.
    
18.  The `delete` function is called, which removes the first element from the circular queue, `5`, and prints `Deleted element: 5`.
    
19.  The program displays the menu of options for the user to choose from:

```r
1. INSERT
2. DELETE
3. DISPLAY
4. EXIT
Enter your choice:
```

20.  The user enters `3` to display the elements of the circular queue.
    
21.  The `display` function is called, which prints the remaining elements of the circular queue:

```r
QUEUE:
3
```

22.  The program displays the menu of options for the user to choose from:

```r
1. INSERT
2. DELETE
3. DISPLAY
4. EXIT
Enter your choice:
```

23.  The user enters `4` to exit the program.
    
24.  The `main` function returns and the program ends.
